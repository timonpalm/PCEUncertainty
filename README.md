# Polynomial Chaos Expansion for Uncertainty Propagation

This notebook was created as an addition for a presentation in the seminar Uncertainty in Machine Learning WiSe23/24.

The purpose of this notebook is a very basic introduction on how to create Polynomial Chaos Expansion for a function with the use of the [chaos](https://chaospy.readthedocs.io/en/master/) library.

To see you you can construct a PCE by hand I can really recommend the [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-Qio-n6yPc) and the corresponding [notebook](https://emilygorcenski.com/pydata-berlin.ipynb) by [Emily Gorcenski](https://emilygorcenski.com/)
